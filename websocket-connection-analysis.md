# WebSocket Connection Analysis: CLIENT_READY Message Flow

## Problem Description
The WebSocket connection was being closed prematurely due to a race condition in handling the `CLIENT_READY` message. The server was closing connections after 10 seconds if they weren't marked as ready, but the `CLIENT_READY` message wasn't being properly processed.

## Key Files Involved
- `server/src/websocket/WebSocketServer.ts`
  - Handles initial WebSocket connection setup
  - Sets up message handlers
  - Contains timeout logic for unready connections
  - Processes raw messages before passing to MessageHandler

- `server/src/websocket/MessageHandler.ts`
  - Contains core message handling logic
  - Processes `CLIENT_READY` messages
  - Sends `INITIAL_PRESENCE` response
  - Manages connection ready state

- `client/src/contexts/WebSocketContext.tsx`
  - Manages client-side WebSocket connection
  - Sends `CLIENT_READY` message
  - Handles connection state
  - Processes server responses

- `client/src/lib/ChatWebSocket.ts`
  - Handles message formatting
  - Manages WebSocket connection lifecycle
  - Provides message sending interface

## Message Flow
1. Client connects to WebSocket server
2. Server authenticates connection and starts 10-second ready timeout
3. Client sends `CLIENT_READY` message with user info
4. Server should:
   - Clear the timeout
   - Process message in MessageHandler
   - Mark connection as ready
   - Send `INITIAL_PRESENCE` message
5. Client receives `INITIAL_PRESENCE` and enables message sending

## Issues Found
1. Race condition in handling `CLIENT_READY`:
   - Connection ready state was being set in multiple places
   - Message handler wasn't receiving proper logging
   - Timeout was being cleared but ready state wasn't being set correctly

2. Message Processing:
   - Added detailed logging to track message flow
   - Found potential issues with error handling
   - Improved error reporting with stack traces

## Changes Made
1. Removed duplicate timeout clearing from `MessageHandler.ts`
2. Added more detailed logging throughout the message handling flow
3. Improved error handling to capture more details
4. Ensured ready state is only set in `handleClientReady`

## Testing Steps
1. Monitor server logs for:
   - `CLIENT_READY` message receipt
   - Message handler processing
   - `INITIAL_PRESENCE` message sending
2. Watch client logs for:
   - Connection establishment
   - Message sending attempts
   - Ready state changes

## Next Steps
1. Monitor the changes in production
2. Add more comprehensive logging around connection state changes
3. Consider adding connection state machine for better lifecycle management
4. Add metrics for connection ready timing

## Related Issues
- Connection timeout after 10 seconds
- Missing `INITIAL_PRESENCE` message
- Premature `CHANNEL_JOIN` message sending
- Inconsistent connection ready state

## Code Patterns
```typescript
// Server-side message handling
if (parsedMessage.type === WebSocketMessageType.CLIENT_READY) {
  clearTimeout(connection.timeout);
  connection.timeout = null;
  await this.messageHandler.handleMessage(connection, parsedMessage);
}

// Client-side ready check
if (!isReady && type !== WebSocketMessageType.CLIENT_READY) {
  Logger.warn('Attempted to send message before client was ready');
  return;
}
```
