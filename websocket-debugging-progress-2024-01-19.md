# Chat Application WebSocket Debugging Progress Report
*January 19, 2024*

## 1. Issues Identified
1. Messages not appearing when sent
2. Online status indicators not working (gray instead of green)
3. User presence not visible
4. WebSocket connection errors

## 2. Files Modified & Changes Made

### `client/src/components/MessageInput.tsx`
- **Issue**: Duplicate message type causing server rejection
- **Change**: Removed duplicate `type` field from message payload
- **Purpose**: Allow messages to be sent and processed correctly by the server

### `server/src/websocket/MessageHandler.ts`
- **Issue**: Presence system not functioning due to incorrect method calls
- **Changes**:
  - Fixed `getReadyConnections` by using `getConnections().filter()`
  - Implemented proper presence broadcasting
  - Added periodic presence updates
  - Added cleanup for presence intervals
- **Purpose**: Enable real-time user presence tracking and status updates

## 3. Current Issues Being Addressed

### Type Errors in MessageHandler
```typescript
- Property 'filter' does not exist on type 'Set<WebSocketConnection>'
- Property 'broadcast' does not exist on type 'ConnectionManager'
- Property 'presenceInterval' does not exist on type 'WebSocketConnection'
```

## 4. Next Actions

### 1. Fix Type Definitions
- Add missing type definitions for `WebSocketConnection` interface
- Add missing methods to `ConnectionManager` class
- Expected outcome: Resolve TypeScript errors and ensure type safety

```typescript
interface WebSocketConnection {
  presenceInterval?: NodeJS.Timeout;
  // ... other properties
}

class ConnectionManager {
  broadcast(message: string, excludeSockets?: WebSocket[]): void;
  // ... other methods
}
```

### 2. Implement Connection Manager Methods
- Add proper broadcast method to ConnectionManager
- Expected outcome: Enable proper message broadcasting to all connected clients

### 3. Fix Set to Array Conversion
- Modify connection handling to properly convert Set to Array for filtering
- Expected outcome: Enable proper filtering of ready connections

## 5. Expected Results After Fixes
1. Messages should appear immediately when sent
2. Online status indicators should turn green for connected users
3. Users should see each other's presence status
4. WebSocket connections should maintain stability
5. No TypeScript errors in the codebase

## 6. Testing Plan
1. Restart both client and server
2. Clear browser data/localStorage
3. Log in with multiple users
4. Test message sending in different channels
5. Verify presence indicators
6. Monitor WebSocket connection stability

## Current Status
- ✅ Message format fixed in client
- ✅ Presence system implementation updated
- ⏳ Type definitions pending
- ⏳ Connection manager methods pending
- ⏳ Set to Array conversion pending

## Next Review Point
After implementing the type fixes and connection manager methods, we will conduct a full test of the messaging and presence functionality to verify all issues have been resolved.
