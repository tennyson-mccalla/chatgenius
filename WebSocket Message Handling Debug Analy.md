# WebSocket Message Handling Debug Analysis
##Current Understanding
- We have a WebSocketServer class that initializes a MessageHandler instance
- The client successfully sends a CLIENT_READY message
- The message appears to be received but not processed, leading to timeouts
- Logs show MessageHandler construction but no evidence of its methods being called
## Files Currently Known to be Involved
1. server/src/websocket/WebSocketServer.ts
- Main WebSocket server implementation
- Contains setupMessageHandler method
- Initializes MessageHandler instance
- Handles raw message reception and parsing
2. server/src/websocket/MessageHandler.ts
- Contains message processing logic
- Has handleMessage and handleClientReady methods
- Should be processing CLIENT_READY messages but no evidence it's being called

## Files Suspected to be Involved
1. server/src/types/websocket.types.ts
- Defines message types and interfaces
- May have type mismatches affecting message routing
2. server/src/index.ts
- Server initialization
- May provide insight into how WebSocketServer is instantiated
3. server/src/websocket/ConnectionManager.ts
- Manages connection states
- Interacts with MessageHandler
## What We've Done
1. Added logging in WebSocketServer constructor to verify MessageHandler creation
2. Added logging for message parsing and handling attempts
3. Added error handling around messageHandler.handleMessage calls
## What We're Trying to DoAdd comprehensive logging to track:
1. When setupMessageHandler is called for new connections
2. When the message event handler is registered
3. When this.messageHandler is accessed
4. The state of this context in message handlers
## GoalDetermine whether:
1. The message handler is properly bound to the WebSocket instance
2. The event handlers are correctly registered
3. The MessageHandler instance persists throughout the connection lifecycleThis systematic approach should reveal where the message handling chain breaks down.
