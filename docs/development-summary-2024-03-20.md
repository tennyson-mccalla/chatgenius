# Development Summary - March 20, 2024

## Overview
Today's work focused on implementing and fixing the WebSocket-based chat system, particularly around real-time messaging, presence management, and reaction handling. The main goal was to establish a robust WebSocket connection flow and ensure proper message handling between clients and server.

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. WebSocket Connection Management
- Implemented proper WebSocket connection lifecycle
- Added authentication flow with token validation
- Established `CLIENT_READY` message protocol
- Set up presence management system

### 2. Message Handling System
- Implemented server-side message broadcasting
- Added client-side message reception and storage
- Set up unread message counting
- Fixed type mismatches between client and server

### 3. Reaction System
- Added complete reaction handling on both server and client
- Implemented reaction add/remove functionality
- Set up reaction state management
- Added UI updates for reactions

## File Changes

### New Files Created
1. `server/src/websocket/MessageHandler.ts`
   - Handles all incoming WebSocket messages
   - Manages message routing and broadcasting
   - Implements reaction handling

2. `client/src/store/socketHandlers/messageHandlers.ts`
   - Manages client-side message reception
   - Handles reaction updates
   - Updates message store

3. `client/src/contexts/WebSocketContext.tsx`
   - Provides WebSocket context to the application
   - Manages connection lifecycle
   - Handles message routing

### Modified Files
1. `server/src/types/websocket.types.ts`
   - Added reaction-related types
   - Updated WebSocket message types
   - Fixed type inconsistencies

2. `client/src/store/message/store.ts`
   - Added reaction handling
   - Updated message storage logic
   - Added unread count management

### Deleted Files
None

## Outstanding Issues

### 1. Online Status Updates
- Online status is not updating correctly
- Presence updates may be lost during reconnection
- Need to implement proper presence heartbeat system

### 2. Typing Indicators
- Not functioning as expected
- Missing proper debouncing
- Need to implement cleanup for stale typing states

### 3. Message Display
- Messages sent do not appear immediately in the message list
- Potential race condition in message ordering
- Need to implement optimistic updates

### 4. Emoji Reactions
- Reaction counts showing as "0"
- Reaction updates not persisting properly
- Need to implement proper reaction state synchronization

### 5. Channel Visibility
- Users cannot see certain channels
- Potential permission/access control issues
- Need to implement proper channel access management

### 6. Multi-User Login
- Errors occurring when logging in with multiple users
- Potential session management issues
- Need to implement proper session handling

## Action Plan

### Immediate Priorities
1. Fix Online Status
   - Implement presence heartbeat system
   - Add reconnection presence sync
   - Estimated time: 2-3 hours

2. Message Display Issues
   - Add optimistic updates
   - Implement proper message ordering
   - Estimated time: 2-3 hours

3. Reaction System
   - Fix reaction persistence
   - Add proper state synchronization
   - Estimated time: 1-2 hours

### Secondary Priorities
1. Typing Indicators
   - Implement debouncing
   - Add cleanup for stale states
   - Estimated time: 1-2 hours

2. Channel Access
   - Fix permission system
   - Add proper access control
   - Estimated time: 2-3 hours

3. Session Management
   - Implement proper multi-user support
   - Add session tracking
   - Estimated time: 2-3 hours

## Technical Notes

### WebSocket Message Flow
```
Client                Server
  |                     |
  |        AUTH         |
  |------------------>  |
  |    AUTH_SUCCESS     |
  |  <------------------|
  |    CLIENT_READY     |
  |------------------>  |
  |  READY_CONFIRMED    |
  |  <------------------|
  |  PRESENCE_CHANGED   |
  |------------------>  |
```

### State Management
The application uses Zustand for state management with the following stores:
- `messageStore`: Handles message history and reactions
- `presenceStore`: Manages user online status
- `channelStore`: Manages channel state and access
- `unreadStore`: Tracks unread message counts

### Type System
There are two key type definition files:
- `server/src/types/websocket.types.ts`: Server-side types
- `client/src/types/websocket.types.ts`: Client-side types

These need to be kept in sync to ensure proper type safety.

## Recommendations
1. Implement proper error recovery for WebSocket connections
2. Add comprehensive logging for debugging
3. Consider implementing message queue for offline support
4. Add unit tests for message handlers
5. Consider implementing end-to-end tests for critical paths

## Dependencies
- React 18.x
- Zustand for state management
- ws for WebSocket server
- Chakra UI for components
